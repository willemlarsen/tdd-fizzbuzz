* Green - Write the *smallest amount of code* to make the test pass
* Refactor - Clean up the code; delete stray comments, improve naming, remove duplication

Variable Assignment

`let apple = 'apple';`

`const speedOfLight = '299 792 458 m / s'`

    console.log('this will never happen');
} else {

}`

`&&`

The modulo!

`%`
