# TDD FizzBuzz

For a given number entered by a user, generate output matching this pattern:

"1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz..."

# Concepts

Red, Green, Refactor
* Red - Scope the problem as small as possible and write a that fails
* Green - Write the *smallest amount of code* to make the test pass
* Refactor - Clean up the code; delete stray comments, improve naming, remove duplication


Conditional blocks

`if(true === true) { console.log("Hello!"); }`

Blocks with else

`if(true === false) {
    console.log('this will never happen');
} else {
    console.log('this will always happen');
}`

The modulo!

`%`

Functions

`function greet(greeting) {
    console.log(greeting);
}`
